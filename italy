<p>Tuscany encompasses a pretty large area of central Italy, so I’m going to narrow this down to the Val d’Orcia region. Why? Because of its beautiful rolling hills and wonderful medieval hilltop towns. This area of Italy is pure heaven. Stretching from Siena in the north to Montepulciano in the east, and including Pienza, Montalcino, and Monticchiello, this area makes for a great road tour. Get lost on the cyprus lined back roads of the Val d’Orcia and you are bound to have your breath taken away by the beautiful rolling landscape of this region. Find an Agriturismo, rent a car for a few days, and discover this region of Italy that is famous for its wine and photographic beauty</p>
<p>Okay, so the top three are Rome, Venice, and Florence. There’s really no mystery here. If you were to ask visitors to Italy what their favorite Italian city was, I would venture to guess that for many it might be Florence.

Florence is just right in so many ways. The city is just the right size to make it one of the most walkable cities in Italy. The centerpiece of Florence is without a doubt the magnificent Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore, otherwise known as the Duomo, and it should not be missed. This city is the rightful birthplace of the Renaissance and is loaded with wonderful art, architecture, and some of the finest museums in the world, the Uffizi and the Galleria dell’ Accademia. Florence truly is of the most beautiful cities in the world.</p>
